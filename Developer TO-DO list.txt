10/31/20 update:
Because I can't enable network discovery on at work I am unable to create an intranet using the remote
comp as a host computer. This can work on my personal comp with my personal router.

Since it's not possible to do this at work without putting this on the web (will need a login page,
security, and battle it out with security department)...I don't think it's worth the hassle to continue
the project unless it's to make my own portfolio.

Below is still the list required to make a functional form with data validation with postgreSQL..
-----

need the follow with priority on functionality over looks:

1. create simple script that checks if i can add record into work database
2. need another string txt box for vendor number
3. need a dropdown menu that has a list of report (late, open, projection), go for dynamic if possible
4. validate with another table in database to see if record exist(tip: Already have something like this
   in my guard clauses so use that for my "vlookup checks")
5. validate email functionality (tip: use WTForms)
6. update field functionality (tip: create a two more boxes; current record and revision record)
7. venv and test web app works there (copy&paste existing)





Report database schema will be as followed:
PK vendor key
PK vendor gs
name
PK email
Report Name
